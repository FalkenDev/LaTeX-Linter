## About
A terminal based program that ensures common stylistic and configurable rules for TeX files.

Rules that check and fix TeX files:
* Intention (tabs or spaces) for environment blocks (e.g., \begin{itemize} â€¦ \end{itemize}; **( Can be configurable which environments blocks should be excluded )**
* Newline after a sentence for better git support **( Can be set to True or False )**
* Format comments (space after %) **( The space value is adjustable )**
* Blank lines before section, chapter, etc. **( The Blank lines value is adjustable )**


***Every rule can be customized in either settings.json or in terminal***
